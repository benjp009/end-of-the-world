# End of the World

As part of the Microverse curriculum, I have been asked to create a page from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScrpit.

This page will be my first project as a programmer student.

The live version of the webpage is here [The End of the World Website](https://benjp009.github.io/end-of-the-world/)

### Highlights ðŸš€
As part of the design, I have chosen to create a page for an fictive event of the end of the world.

### Pair Programming ðŸŽ³

For the milestone project, there is no Pair Programming required, so I have been working on it by myself.

### Additional requirements

If you decide to implement these requirements, you should do it in a separate pull request. As always, remember to clearly document your decision in GitHub comments.
- [ ] You could implement some UX improvements: add the "More" button on the home page, include transitions and/or animations, etc.
- [ ] You could implement additional pages, like the tickets page and the schedule page. Make sure that you have a decent mobile design for them.
