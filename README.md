# End of the World

As part of the Microverse curriculum, I have been asked to create a page from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScrpit. 

This page will be my first project as a programmer student. 

The live version of the webpage is here [The End of the World Website](https://benjp009.github.io/end-of-the-world/)

### Requirements 🚀
✅ Personalize the content of your page. Choose a topic that is different than the one in the original design.<br>
✅ Follow these design guidelines:  colors.<br>
✅ Follow these design guidelines:  typography: font face, size and weight.<br>
✅ Follow these design guidelines:  layout: composition and space between elements.<br>
✅ Look almost identical to the original design. Small adjustments like text or image changes are acceptable.<br>
- [ ] Use Bootstrap for styling, if you want to.<br>
✅ Build the home page.<br>
- [ ] Build the about page.<br>
- [ ] Each of the pages should have versions for 2 different screens sizes:<br>
  - [ ] Mobile: up to 768px wide.<br>
  - [ ] Desktop: 768px or wider.<br>
- [ ] Interactions<br>
  - [ ] Links<br>
    - [ ] The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.<br>
    - [ ] The logo in the header links to the home page.<br>
  - [ ] Mobile menu<br>
    - [ ] When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.<br>
    - [ ] There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).<br>
    - [ ] The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.<br>
✅ Dynamic page<br>
  ✅ The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.<br>
  ✅ Use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.<br>
✅ The Creative Commons license of the design requires that you give appropriate credit to the author. Therefore, you must do it in the README of your project.<br>


### Pair Programming 🎳

For the milestone project, there is no Pair Programming required, so I have been working on it by myself. 

### Additional requirements

If you decide to implement these requirements, you should do it in a separate pull request. As always, remember to clearly document your decision in GitHub comments.
- [ ] You could implement some UX improvements: add the "More" button on the home page, include transitions and/or animations, etc.
- [ ] You could implement additional pages, like the tickets page and the schedule page. Make sure that you have a decent mobile design for them.
